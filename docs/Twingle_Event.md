# Twingle Event

The *Twingle Event* campaign type represents peer-to-peer events created by users. The campaigns get synchronized
between Twingle and CiviCRM in only one direction: from Twingle to CiviCRM. There is no need to synchronize them through
the other direction, because usually it is not necessary to change their values. *Twingle Events* are created by users
through a *Twingle Project* of type event.

You can activate the creation of soft credits for event initiators. In this case a donation by person A will be linked
as soft credit to person B which is the event initiator.
